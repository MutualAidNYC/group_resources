Resources to support Mutual Aid groups to get started and manage ongoing operations 

## Goals:	
- To provide a directory of resources to support Mutual Aid groups to get up and running quickly
- To assist Mutual Aid networks move towards using common data models so that existing datasets can be plugged in quickly
- To assist Mutual Aid networks move towards being able to adopt APIs to connect data and automate as much as possible as needs grow

## Description
This GitHub lists resources for mutual aid groups that want to set up quickly, using the practices and models that other groups have used. Over time, it is hoped this list can help identify common data models that groups are using to categorise: 
- support offered
- support needed
- local support groups.
(These seem to be the three common groupings needed for data models).

Best practices are also shared, for example, MutualAid.NYC has put its mapping code online so that if other groups are using mapbox and airtable for showing where local support is available, they can copy this code and adapt it to their area.)

## Contribute
Feel free to send a pull request, or contact me directly to add resources to this list. I chose GitHub because it allows anyone to edit and add to the directory. There is also a version of this on my own website that I will keep aligned with this repo, for those who would prefer to read it in a blog post format. Any other ideas for using a platform where people can contribute and even comment on resources would be useful (for example, i am happy to create a DocuWiki if people prefer that format).

## Acknowledgements
The bulk of this resource list was collected by Hannah Brown for the Mutual Aid US group.

## Warning
The resources shared here have not been validated as best practices. Join the mutual aid US slack group or contact the resource creators directly if you are unsure if they could apply to your area. It may be helpful to always seek out an existing user before adopting any of these resources so you know their limitations or where you may need to customise your implementation.

## Setting up a group
- One of the best maintained databases of resources for mutual aid groups can be found here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HEdNpLB5p-sieHVK-CtS8_N7SIUhlMpY6q1e8Je0ToY/edit#gid=832179775
It was created by Database by Shadia Fayne Wood. While the below lists repeat many of these resources organised into the categories below, keep an eye on this resource as it is being added to regularly.
